# Road-Trip-Race

### [**Live Game Demo **]("#")<br>

*Road Trip Race* is an authentic, single-player fast paced Spanish language learning game that is geared for both beginners and intermediate-advanced users.

The race takes place in South America, and the goal is to make it to each country before time runs out! 

**Don't know much about South America?** Fear not! Each question will quiz your Spanish vocabulary as well as educate you on the culture, customs, and traditions within each country.

**Careful!** For each question answer incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from your timer. Luckily, for every right answer, 5 seconds will be added.
